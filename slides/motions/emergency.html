<h1>Western Sahara - emergency motion.</h1><p>

This Annual General Meeting reaffirms the solidarity of Woodcraft Folk with the Saharawi people in their struggle for self determination and freedom from detention and torture for seeking what is their right by international law. We are appalled at the brutal repression of the occupying Moroccan state meted out to young Saharawis in the occupied territory and the recent imprisonment of 24 Saharawis following military trial and torture. </p><p>

We resolve to extend the historic links of Woodcraft Folk with young people in the Saharawi refugees camps and strive to find imaginative ways of exchange, links, and support, and to inform the membership, groups and districts about the plight of Saharawi refugees since 1975. </p>
