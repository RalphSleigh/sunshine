<h1>Motion 2. Reform of General Council and Creation of a Folk Assembly</h1>

<p><em><b>Supporting Information:</b></em></p>

<p><em>
The present General Council is too large, making decision-making and governance difficult to manage
and time-consuming. General Council are proposing a restructure, by reducing the Trustees/Directors to a
board of ten, consisting of: four elected Trustees/Directors shall be elected at each Annual Conference,
for a duration of two years each; a District Fellow elected by the DF Committee, and; an appointed
Treasurer on a five-year term.</em></p><p><em>
General Council will be supported by three committees of lay members, namely Education & Groups
Committee, Campaigns & Communications Committee and Joint Centres and Campsites Committee.
These three committees and General Council will together make up the Folk Assembly. Each of the three
committees will have a convenor elected from the General Council. The Education & Groups Committee
and Campaigns & Communications Committee will each have two elected members, one elected each
Annual Conference for a period of two years. The working group will invite other members to join as they
wish.</em></p>
