<h1>Motion 7. Individual Membership Fees</h1><p>
This Annual General Meeting notes that the fees charges to individual members have not changed for
many years and are currently &pound;25 per waged person, and &pound;10 per unwaged or low waged member.</p><p>
This Meeting sets the fees to apply from 1st June 2013 as &pound;30 per waged person and &pound;12 per unwaged
or low waged member. All members are also encouraged to sign up for direct debit and a monthly
donation according to what they feel they can afford. The minimum would be &pound;2.50 per month for waged,
and &pound;3 every 3 months for unwaged/low paid members (monthly payments of &pound;1 per month would be
expensive in bank charges and admin time).</p><p><em>
Proposed and seconded by: General Council</em></p>
