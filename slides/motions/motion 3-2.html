<h1>Motion 3. System for Elections to General Council</h1>
<p><b><em>
Supporting Information:</em></b></p><p><em>
At the moment Woodcraft Folk uses an STV (Single Transferable Vote) system for General Council
elections. Our understanding of the current voting system is that only the votes putting a candidate first
really count, along with some second votes either once candidates are over the threshold or of the first
person eliminated. A candidate with few first votes but a large number of second and third votes is not
going to be elected.</em></p><p><em>
The voting system we use is still not properly understood by the wider membership, or even some
General Council members themselves. Even Standing Orders Committee appear to be having problems
with it; it proving more difficult than expected to publish the results as agreed at the last Annual Gathering.</em></p><p><em>
The block vote system will allow members to show their support for a number of candidates with the
different skills and personalities needed for General Council. That is, if there are five places, you get five
votes of which you can use as many as you want, but only one per candidate. The people with the most
votes will be elected. The membership cannot successfully vote for a group of people under the present
system.</em></p>
