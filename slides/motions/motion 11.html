<h1>Motion 11. Badges for Group Members</h1><p>
This Annual General Meeting notes that a new initiative, badges for child membership, has been
approved and that new badges were issued in 2012, according to the average number of children in a
group. We find this initiative un-workable, as the average number of children is not the same as the full
number, especially as children leave the group and new ones join during the year. Therefore, with less
than the required number of badges, we find they cannot be distributed to all children, and so cannot be
distributed at all. We instruct General Council to approve the sale of these badges through Folk Supply at
cost plus postage â€“ not the &pound;5 currently charged.</p><p><em>
