<h1>Amendment to motion 11: "Badges for Group Members"</h1><p>
Amend as follows:<ol><li> Change 2012 to 2013;</li><li>
Delete 'average' in front of 'number of children'</li><li>
Delete 'as the average number of children is not the same as the full number, especially'.</li></ol>
The amended motion will read as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left:3em">This Annual Conference notes that a new initiative, badges for child membership, has been approved
and that new badges were issued in 2013, according to the number of children in a group. We find
this initiative un-workable, as children leave the group and new ones join during the year. Therefore,
with less than the required number of badges, we find they cannot be distributed to all children, and
so cannot be distributed at all. We ask Conference to approve the sale of these badges through Folk
Supply at cost plus postage â€“ not the &pound;5 currently charged.</p><p><em>
