<h1>The Banks are Made of Marble</h1>

<p>Oh I’ve wandered through this country,<br />
From shore to silver shore,<br />
And it really made me wonder<br />
All the things I heard and saw.</p>

<p>Yes I’ve seen the weary farmer.<br />
Ploughing up the soil and loam,<br />
And I’ve heard the auction hammer,<br />
It was knocking down their home.</p>
