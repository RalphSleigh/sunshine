<p>Chorus<br />
But the banks are made of marble,<br />
With a guard on every door,<br />
And the vaults are stacked with silver,<br />
That the miner sweated for.</p><p>

Yes I’ve seen the weary fisherman<br />
Standing idly on the shore,<br />
And I’ve heard his bosses saying,<br />
Got no work for you no more.</p>
