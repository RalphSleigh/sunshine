In sixteen fourty nine, to St Georges hill<br />
A ragged band they called the diggers came to show the peoples will<br />
They defied the landlords, they defied the laws.<br />
They were the disposessed reclaiming what was theirs.<br /><br />

You poor take courage, you rich take care<br />
This earth was made a common treasurey for everyone to share<br />
All things in common, all people one<br />
We come in peace - the orders came to cut them down.
