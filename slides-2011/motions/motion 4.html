<h1>Motion 4: Enable 5 year membership for DFs</h1><p>
This Annual Conference recognises that large numbers of memberships lapse between the ages of 16
and 20, a time of change in many peoples lives. Therefore this Annual Conference resolves to allow 16 to
20 year olds to buy 5 year memberships which will not only keep them in the Woodcraft Folk but decrease
administrative costs and improve cash flow.</p><p><em>
