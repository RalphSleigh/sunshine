<h1>Motion 5. Campaign Against Military Recruitment in Schools</h1>
<p>
This Annual General Meeting supports the DF movement's campaign against military recruitment in
schools. Woodcraft Folk calls for an end to the recruitment of children into the armed forces as it goes
against our Aims and Principles as well as contravening the recommendations of the UN Committee on
the Rights of the Child.</p><p>
We call on the relevant Minister in the Ministry of Defence (currently Mark Francois MP) to change their
recruitment practices in light of the UK's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which
opposes the recruitment of children into the armed forces.</p><p>
This Annual Gathering also recognises that the new Woodcraft Folk campaign "Our Times" on war and
politics is a good opportunity for this issue to be discussed and campaigned on. We see this issue as a
priority for young people and recommend that the campaign reflects this.</p><p><em>
Proposed and seconded by: DF Committee</em></p>
