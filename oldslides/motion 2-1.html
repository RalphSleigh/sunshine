<h1>Motion 2. Reform of General Council and Creation of a Folk Assembly</h1>

<p>This Annual General Meeting Notes:<ol><li>
General Council is the Trustee Board of Woodcraft Folk but it takes on work beyond that of a board
of Directors (such as Education work and Campaigns).</li><li>
General Council is larger than recommended best practice and is often too big to operate well.</li><li>
Finance and General Purpose Committee takes on much of the Trustee Board responsibility.</li></ol>
This Annual General Meeting agrees to:<ol><li>
Create a Folk Assembly which will bring together all committees, Development Conferences and
representation from around the movement to meet at least two times a year.</li><li>
Remove from office all General Council members in 2014 and seek re-elections according to a new
structure.</li><li>
Amend the Aims, Principles and Programmes "GC: General Council" and "Standing Orders SO.25"
to read:</li></ol></p>

Proposed and Seconded by: General Council
