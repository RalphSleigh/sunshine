<h1>Motion 6. Individual & Group Membership Fees</h1><p>
This Annual General Meeting agrees that the individual membership fee shall be a minimum of &pound;12 per
member and that the group registration fee shall be a minimum of &pound;35 per group (Woodchip, Elfin,
Pioneer and Venturer) plus &pound;12 per young member. This results in all members, regardless of age, paying
the same amount.</p><p>
This meeting calls upon members to try and pay individual memberships via direct debit and where
possible gift aid the donation to the movement.<p><p><em>
