<h1>Motion 6. Individual & Group Membership Fees</h1><p>

<p><em><b>Supporting Information:</b></em></p>
<p><em>At the time of writing we have 322 paying groups, 1,348 waged adult members, 1,106 unwaged or low
waged adult members and 4,186 young members. We changed the membership fee in 2012 but this has
led to a shortfall in fees to the core budget.</em></p>

<p><em>
It may be that groups take ownership of all individual membership fees and that adult members pay subs.
But having a system where the fee is the same is a much fairer system and we encourage those who can
afford more donate more.</em></p>
