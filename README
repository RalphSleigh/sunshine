This is a networked conferencing tool designed for Woodcraft Folk's annual gathering, can display HTML slides/notices and provides a networked text chat system.

Currently being re-written, lots of things to don't work, but in general:

1) Update composer to pull in required vendor files
2) point apache at the public directory
3) run server.sh to start the websocket server, it listens on 12345.
4) hit up /dashboard/ or /slides/ in your www client (latest chrome supported, should work in others but on your own).
