<h1>Motion 8. Group Registration Fees 2014 (applicable to all groups other than DFs)</h1>
<p>
This Annual General Meeting Notes:<ol><li>
The 2013 registration fees are &pound;52 per group plus &pound;5 per child or young person.</li><li>
For the average group of 13 children or young people this means group registration fees of &pound;117.</li><li>
The cost of administering and supporting a group is around &pound;300 per year.</li><li>
According to our governing documents a child or young person attending more than four
 sessions, or an overnight stay, is considered a young member of Woodcraft Folk.</li></ol>
This Annual General Meeting Agrees:<ol><li>
From 2014, the minimum registration fee will be &pound;52 plus &pound;6 per child or young person.</li><li>
To request that from 2014 groups who can afford it make a donation in addition to their
 registration fee.</li></ol>
This meeting hopes that these donations will bring groups' contributions to the national movement as
close to &pound;300 as they can afford. This meeting welcomes donations of any size.</p><p><em>
Proposed and seconded by: General Council</em></p>
