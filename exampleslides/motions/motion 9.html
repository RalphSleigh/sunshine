<h1>Motion 9. Friends of the Folk</h1><p>
This Annual General Meeting welcomes the initiative to create a 'Friends of the Folk' network to
encourage individual and collective donations to the movement.</p><p>
We consider that this should have a local as well as a movement-wide aspect.</p><p>
This meeting resolves:
<ol><li>
That donors should be given the option of allocating a named percentage of their donation to
a named District or Lone Group.</li><li>
That Districts and Lone Groups should be encouraged to set up local branches of 'Friends of
the Folk' from which a named percentage of their donation would be allocated to the District
or Lone Group and the remainder to national Woodcraft Folk.</li></ol></p>
<p><em>Proposed by: Hackney District<br />
