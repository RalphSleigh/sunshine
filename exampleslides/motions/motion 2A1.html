<h1>Motion 2: "Reform of General Council and Creation of a Folk Assembly" - Amended by amendment 1</h1>

<p>
This Annual General Meeting Notes: <ol><li>
General Council is the Trustee Board of Woodcraft Folk but it takes on work beyond that of a board
of Directors (such as Education work and Campaigns). </li><li>
General Council is larger than recommended best practice and is often too big to operate well. </li><li>
Finance and General Purpose Committee takes on much of the Trustee Board responsibility. </li></ol>
 


</p>

<p>

This Annual General Meeting instructs General Council to:
<ol><li>
Bring to AG2014 a fully developed new governance structure based upon the co-operative and mutualist principles of the labour and co-operative movement, rather than corporate or charity structures. This should be in the form of a report that lays out the problem and options for change.</li><li>
The report shall include the option to create a Folk Assembly which will bring together all committees, Development Conferences and representation from around the movement, and meet at least two times a year. The purpose of the Folk Assembly and its relationship with the General Council must be clearly stated, especially for any option for change that reduces the size of the General Council.</li><li>
The report shall further include an option for the Folk Assembly to include representation from districts, nations and regions.</li><li>
The report shall include a costing for the option it recommends to the movement and details of how this cost can be met.
