<p>Chorus<br />
But the banks are made of marble,<br />
With a guard on every door,<br />
And the vaults are stacked with silver<br />
That the farmers sweated for.</p><p>

Yes I’ve seen the weary miner,<br />
Brushing coal dust from his back,<br />
And I’ve heard his children crying,<br />
Got no coal to heat the shack.</p><p>
