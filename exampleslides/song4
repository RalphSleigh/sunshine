<p>Chorus<br />
But the banks are made of marble,<br />
With a guard on every door,<br />
And the vaults are stacked with silver,<br />
That the seaman sweated for.</p><p>

Yes I’ve seen my brothers sweating,<br />
Throughout this mighty land,<br />
And I pray they’ll get together<br />
And together they will stand.</p>
