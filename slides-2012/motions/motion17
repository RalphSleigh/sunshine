<b>Motion 17: Support the Co-operative Groupâ€™s
anti-fracking campaign</b>
<p>
This Annual Conference notes the conclusions of the report on Shale Gas Development (hydraulic
fracturing) by the Tyndal Centre for Climate Change research.
This report highlights concerns about the environmental and health risks of shale gas development
including:-<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
The release of significant quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere - the exploitation
of an additional fossil fuel resource will likely increase energy use, increasing greenhouse gas
emissions further</li><li>
Potential groundwater contamination associated with chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing
process and the mobilisation of heavy metals and hydrocarbons</li><li>
The extraction of significant quantities of water for hydraulic fracturing</li></ul></p>
<p>This conference therefore calls for a moratorium on the development of shale gas and hydraulic
fracturing in the UK until all associated risks are fully understood and instructs General Council to
support the anti-fracking campaign</p>
<i>Proposed and Seconded by: General Council.</i>
