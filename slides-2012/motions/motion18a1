<b>Amendment to motion 18:</b><p>
To amend “This Annual Conference agrees...[to end]” to “This Annual Conference mandates General
Council to convene a steering group to co-ordinate the campaign which will:<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
highlight the issue, initially with other youth movements in Britain, and then with likely allies such
as trade unions, certain MPs, and the media.</li><li>
kick-start the campaign, gathering evidence from the last two International Camps held in the UK
regarding which groups were refused entry to Britain, which were not and the breadth of problems
caused to delegations and hosts.</li><li>
encourage other youth organisations to do the same. Ultimately, the aim of the campaign will be
to persuade the Government to relax visa controls for delegations attending future International
Camps and youth events in Britain Incredibly helpful expertise appeared when problems were
encountered obtaining visas, however this was very late on in the process and many hosting
Districts had already had decisions made regarding their Delegations. The steering group should
ensure that expert advice and support resources should be on the Central website at the earliest
possible opportunity.”</li></ul></p>
<i>Proposed and Seconded by General Council.</i>
