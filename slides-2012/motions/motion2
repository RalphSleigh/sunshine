<b>Motion 2: Safeguarding Panels - Substantive </b><p>
This Annual Conference instructs General Council to revise the procedure for safeguarding panels
within the Woodcraft Folk. This Annual Conference believes that the first panel should be convened
by the General Council (or a sub-committee if required by time constrains) and should be drawn from a selection of lay members who have
previously received appropriate safeguarding training.</p><p>
If the person being investigated wishes to appeal against the findings of the initial panel, the
General Council should convene an appeal panel independent of the initial panel made up of either
lay members (who have received appropriate training) or external expertise whose decision will be
final, pending possible appeal to conference.</p>
<p>None of these panels can include members local to the member
investigated
