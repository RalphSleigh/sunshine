<b>Motion 12: Ceremonies</b><p>
This Annual Conference recognises the importance and value of Woodcraft’s traditional ceremonies,
for instance the Fire Lighting Ceremony. However, whilst it’s important to value tradition, we should
not do this at the expense of inclusiveness. Therefore, this conference requests that Folk Supply
should remove gender-exclusive terms such as ‘brothers’ and ‘mote master’ in the next edition of the
Woodcraft Folk song book. Folk Supply should replace them with acceptable alternatives, or instance
‘siblings/brothers and sisters’ and ‘mote keeper’.</p>
