<b>Motion 22: Financial management when organising
events</b>
<p>This Annual Conference agrees that following on from our decision to remain as a single charity, we
should bear equal responsibility for equipment and related costs. We commit Woodcraft Folk at all
levels to aim at not making a loss in any of our activities – group nights, camps and other events. Very
little that we do is free – for example, using existing camping equipment means wear and tear costs
and, eventually, the need to replace this equipment.</p>
