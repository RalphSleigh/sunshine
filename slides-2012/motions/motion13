<b>Motion 13: District Fellows Movement Events</b><p>
This Annual Conference instructs General Council, District Fellows Movement and Venturer
committee to draw together a working group(from the wider movement) to look at the management
of events run by young people for young people and how we, as a movement, can support these
events.
In particular we ask the working group to look at:<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
Management of events</li><li>
Code of conduct</li><li>
How we empower and support those responsible for events</li><li>
Any additional issues that may arise from the working group</li></ul></p>
<i>Proposed and Seconded by Boveney District.</i>
<p><b>Supporting information:</b><i>
As a movement we should be proud of the fact that so many young people come forward and are
prepared to engage in and organise events for their peers. However, with the highlight of the Gentleman’s’
Club, a number of issues were raised that need to be faced up to. A working group of experienced and
young members looking at issues and management of events, we felt would go towards reinstating
confidence in these events.
These events do not have the support of a district meeting regularly and being a ‘friendship’ group and
many people join the movement at this age not having the benefits of the education during the younger
age groups.
We do not feel that the Woodcraft Folk can ignore these issues as they tend to lead to two tier
movement and that facing up to our responsibilities to support young people is the way forward for the
movement.</i></p>
