<b>Motion 1: Making a branch structure a reality</b>
<p>Supporting information:<br />
Presently General Council are personally liable for everything that happens at Woodcraft events, group
nights and events, they hold on trust, all assets (money and property) for the members, and could face
personal liability for the actions of any member. Limiting this would mean that they were offered some
protection.</p><p>
The model rules proposed by General Council can be found on http://www.woodcraft.org.uk/branch-
structure. Model rules were circulated twice to members between December 2011 and January 2012 for
consultation as well as a workshop being run at Annual Gathering 2011 with the first draft.
Amendments to the rules may be made by amending this motion or at rule amendment years which
are every 3 years, with the next one being 2013.</p><p>
General Council will present a number of amendments to their own motion to amend the rules so as
to give members a choice on key issues, particularly in relation to the make up of General Council. These
can be seen on http://www.woodcraft.org.uk/branch-structure, we advise that before amendments are
submitted for the rules this page is consulted so as to avoid double amendments, see the rationale of some
changes and also seek legal support for any changes that you wish to bring.</p>
