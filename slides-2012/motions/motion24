<b>Motion 24: Support the District Fellows Movement to
become an independent organisation</b><p>
This Annual Conference congratulates the District Fellows Movement on its coming of age. It is now
time for the District Fellows Movement to be encouraged to take the next step in its development by
becoming an independent partner co-operative organisation. We call upon General Council to assist
the District Fellows Movement in investigating the best way forward.</p>

The DF movement would be better served to itself and the wider Woodcraft Folk by becoming an
independent co-operative organisation. This would allow it to develop its own policies and campaigns.
It would also give it the opportunity to look at its age range and decide itself whether it wanted to be a
young adult organisation with perhaps an upper age range of 25. By being an independent co-operative
organisation it would not have the same restraints that the Charity Commission imposes on a children
and youth organisation i.e. The Woodcraft Folk.<br />
This would also draw a distinction between young people who wish to train as group leaders and
those young people who at their stage of development wish to join a young personâ€™s organisation with the
aims and principles of the Woodcraft Folk.</p>
