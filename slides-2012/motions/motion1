<b>Motion 1: Making a branch structure a reality</b>
<p>This Annual Conference notes:<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
The decision of conference 2009 and 2010 to adopt a Branch Structure</li>
</li><li>The advice received by the General Council that we should incorporate the charity in this process
so as to clearly become a Branch structure and protect the trustees against liabilities</li>
<li>That currently under 18 year olds are not allowed to be members of co-operatives which are
industrial and provident societies and therefore this option is not desirable to conference.</li></ul></p>
<p>This conference resolves to:<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
Establish the Woodcraft Folk (Company Limited by Guarantee), registering in England and
Wales and in Scotland by 31st December 2012, empowering the General Council to be the initial
members of the organisation, until the transfer date</li><li>
To adopt the Memorandum and Articles (the rules) proposed by General Council as the initial
rules of the Woodcraft Folk (Company Limited by Guarantee)</li><li>
Empower the General Council to dissolve, under article W of the constitution, the present charity
of the Woodcraft Folk (1073665 &SC039791), after the transfer date, transferring all members,
assets and property, contracts and liabilities to the Woodcraft Folk (Company Limited by
Guarantee)</li><li>
Empower the General Council to set the transfer date which maybe at a time of their choosing, but
before or on 31st December 2013.</li></ul></p>
