<b>Motion 5: Annual review of registration fee - Substantive A1</b>
<p>This Annual Conference notes that it is a regular occurrence that group registration fees are increased.
That while the gaps between increasing the fee are left for long periods that the fee has to increase in
larger amounts when it is increased.
This conference re-affirms that it is this body that sets the membership fees, but that it is usually
General Council who proposes increases. That with a more regular assessment and proposal from
General Council to the conference a smoother increase of fees can be achieved.
This conference therefore resolves to insert in the Aims, Principle and Programme (and
renumber):
FIN:3	That a group registration fee shall be levied on all groups as according to the constitution
(F1i). A fee shall be proposed by the General Council and agreed by the membership at
Annual Conference.</p>
<i>Proposed and Seconded by: General Council.</i>
