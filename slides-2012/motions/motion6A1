<b>Amendment to motion 6:</b><p>
Change it to “This Annual Conference agrees that the group registration fee should rise in 2013 to £52 plus £5
per child.”.</p>

<p><b>Supporting information:</b><i>
At a time of squeezed pay settlements it is unreasonable to increase fees to already over burdened groups.
The increase of group registration from £50 to £52 represents an increase of 4%. The addition of a child
rate increase represents 4% (approx). Clearly this is unacceptable. The amendment allows an increase to
the central group fee.</i></p>
