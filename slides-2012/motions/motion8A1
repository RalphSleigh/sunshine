<p><b>Supporting information:</b><i>
The TUC and the trade union movement are not the same. Firstly there are unions that aren’t in the
TUC and secondly individual unions are sovereign, democratic bodies, accountable to their membership
... not the TUC. The motion confuses and conflates the two things. Additionally a shared and co-
operative agenda for convergence needs to be arrived at through discussion. A person from the TUC
would only be able to influence matters in the TUC, not necessarily the wider movement and unless they
were a sufficient “big hitter” would add little of value to General Council.</i></p>
