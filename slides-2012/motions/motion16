<b>Motion 16: Park Farm</b><p>
This Annual Conference agrees the sale of Park Farm and requests that General Council aim to sell
the site at the best possible price to the most ethical buyer. The funds should be used to help central
reserves recover and invest in development projects. A certain amount of the money, decided by
General Council, should be ring fenced in order to buy a new campsite. Potentially, this could form
part of the Project Koodoo fund or it could be used to purchase a new campsite that Woodcraft can
use and hire out to its full potential.</p>

<p><b>Supporting information:</b><i>
Park Farm would be a great site if Woodcraft could use it to its full potential. However, we can only use
it for 60 nights of the year for up to 100 people because of the local council’s restrictions. The site is big
enough to host, and has hosted in the past, international camps. This conference recognises it’s a very
sensitive issue and realises there are benefits of Park Farm.<br />
However, there are far more pros than cons. The capital we have in Park Farm could be reinvested
elsewhere to much better use. In order to best fulfil our aims and principles of peace, cooperation,
friendship and education it is vital we sell Park Farm. Woodcraft is not in the secure financial position
to have the luxury of a site we can barely use ourselves, let alone hire out to bring money into the
organisation.</i></p>
