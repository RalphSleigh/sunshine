<b>Motion 26: re-affirm non-use of ‘How’</b>
<p>
This Annual Conference reaffirms its previous decision to cease using the word “How” in Woodcraft
Folk activities. The word perpetuates racial stereotyping of Native American nations. This conference
instructs General Council to consider how best to ensure compliance with this policy across the
movements’ groups, preferably through an educational method if it is felt necessary.</p>
<i>Proposed and Seconded by: Azania Pioneers.</i>
<p><b>Supporting information:</b><i>
It has been assumed that groups would adhere to policy voted upon at Annual Gathering. But there is
evidence that some groups were unaware of the decision to cease using “How” and others held debates
within their districts as to whether to comply with an Annual Gathering mandate. Racial stereotyping
has no place in the Woodcraft Folk, even so called positive racial stereotyping. No all Native American
people lived in tipis, danced around totem poles and said “How.” A respect for native peoples is to be
encouraged, racial stereotyping is not.</i></p>
