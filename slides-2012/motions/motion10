<b>Motion 10: Project Koodoo</b><p>
This Annual Conference notes that a new initiative, Project Koodoo, has been suggested at CoCamp,
which is an intention to purchase a new campsite for the Folk. We consider this idea to be a needless
diversion from our strategic aims such as our efforts to attain the objectives in the Big Plan, especially
in these times when groups are struggling to survive and grow. Furthermore, this conference believes
that the movement needs to clear the current budget deficit and demonstrate an ability to manage our
budget successfully for some years before launching into such a large and potentially risky venture.</p>
