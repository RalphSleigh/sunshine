<b>Motion 20: Childcare at events</b>
<p>
This Annual Conference reasserts our collective responsibility to offer childcare facilities at ALL
Woodcraft Folk training events for volunteers. Therefore, trainees may assume that childcare is
provided at all events and this must be clearly stated if it is not.</p>
<i>Proposed and Seconded by: Leicestershire District.</i>
