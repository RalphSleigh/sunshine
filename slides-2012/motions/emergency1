<b>Emergency Motion 1: Enforcing Suspension of
Hamahanot Haolim from IFM-SEI</b>
<p>This conference notes:<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
The continued illegal occupation of the West bank and Gaza by Israeli forces in contravention of
UN resolutions.</li><li>
The continued building programmes moving Israeli settlers into these areas and effectively
annexing these territories into the Israeli state.</li><li>
The boycott campaign supported by trade unions and the Woodcraft Folk of Israeli produce and
products emanating from these illegal settlements.</li></ul></p><p>
This conference further notes:<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
That Hamahanot Haolim (an Israeli IFM affiliate) has been suspended from member of IFM due
to its operation of a settlement on the West Bank. This effectively binds them to accepting the
legitimacy of annexation and incompatible with membership of IFM .</li><li>
Despite its suspension from IFM, it was invited to attend “Queer Easter” organised by the Red
Falcons in Germany.</li></ul></p><p>
This conference believes that suspension should mean that Hamahanot Haolim cannot attend events
organised by IFM or its affiliates, otherwise suspension is a meaningless sanction.
This conference therefore instructs General Council to:<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
Write to IFM HQ and convey the views expressed in this motion and state our belief that
Hamahanot Haolim should not visit IFM HQ unless the meeting is to resolve the issue of their
suspension.</li><li>
Propose that unless progress is made by the end of May 2012 in the suspension and if the
outstanding issues remain, that Hamahanot Haolim should be expelled from IFM, and that the
Woodcraft Folk will support a call for this to happen.</li><li>
That all Woodcraft Folk and its staff are to boycott activities where Hamahanot Haolim are invited.</li><ul></p>
