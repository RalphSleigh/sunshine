<b>Motion 21: Elfin & Pioneer-friendly large camps</b>

<p>This Annual Conference recognises that recent international camps have not attracted many Elfins or
their parents, or (to some extent) Pioneers. This Conference resolves that any future very large camps
will be organised for all members of Woodcraft Folk.</p>
<i>Proposed and Seconded by: Cambridge.</i>
<p><b>Supporting information:</b><i>
There are probably more Elfin age children in the Folk than any other age group, yet of the 2447 at
CoCamp only 150 (6%) were Elfins and 331 (14%) were Pioneers. Many parents were put off attending,
particularly those with younger children.</i></p>
