<b>Motion 18: Visas</b>
<p>This Annual Conference notes that last yearâ€™s successful motion from Brighton Central and Hove
District regarding a Campaign on visa regulations, instructing General Council to facilitate the
organisation of a campaign has not been acted on.
Following the difficulties faced by many foreign delegations obtaining visas to attend Co-Camp,
especially from Asia and Africa, we would like this addressed.
This Annual Conference agrees the following:-<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
A campaign is started to highlight the issue, initially with other youth movements in Britain, and
then with likely allies such as trade unions, certain MPs and media.</li><li>
To kick-start this campaign, the General Council will gather evidence from the last two
International Camps held in England regarding which groups were refused entry to Britain, which
were not and the breadth of problems caused to delegations and hosts.</li><li>
The General Council will seek to encourage other youth organisations to do the same.</li><li>
Ultimately, the aim of the campaign will be to persuade the Government to relax visa controls for
delegations attending future International Camps and youth events in Britain.</li><li>
Incredibly helpful expertise appeared when problems were encountered obtaining visas, however
this was very late on in the process and many hosting Districts had already had decisions made
regarding their Delegations. General Council should ensure that expert advice and support
resources should be on the Central website at the earliest possible opportunity.</li></ul></p>
