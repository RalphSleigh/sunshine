<b>Motion 7: Add to AP&P section on Trades Unions</b>
<p>This Annual Conference resolves to add a new clause to the Aims, Principles and Programme
Document.</p><p>
Insert new A&P 9: Towards social and economic equality<br />
	
The Woodcraft Folk recognises the importance of co-operation and mutualism in the
struggle to achieve a society based upon equality. Trade Unions have been in the forefront
of the struggle to make this a reality. The Woodcraft Folk therefore supports membership of
Trade Unions, broadly supports their aspirations and urges members’ active participation
within them.</p>
<i>Proposed and Seconded by: Azania Pioneers.</i>
<p><b>Supporting information:</b><i>
Membership of Trade Unions is encouraged in PROG.14. However the recent November 30th public
sector strike revealed some elements within the Woodcraft Folk not supporting the strike. In the current
period the organisations in the front line against the “austerity” policies of the Government are the trade
unions. A closer working relationship with trade unions could be facilitated by a more concrete statement
of support for trade unions in civic society within our aims and principles.</i></p>
