<b>Motion 3: Safeguarding Review</b>
<p>

This Annual Conference calls for a review of the current Woodcraft Folk safeguarding procedures in
the context of the aims, principles and nature of the organisation. The review shall be independent of
Folk Office Administration and General Council and to be carried on by a law professional with an
understanding of the aims, principles and ethos of the organisation.

Recent experiences have shown that the current safeguarding procedures donâ€™t provide adequate
protection to the member/volunteer under investigation; whether this is required by law needs to be
clarified. It was also seen that the right composition of the investigation panels, independent and without
local involvement, is paramount to preserve impartiality and minimise tensions in the affected Districts.
Apart from the obvious arguments on justice and basic rights, the current safeguarding procedures leave
adult members in a vulnerable situation and endanger stability at local level, compromising the strategy
for growth approved at the 2011 AGM.</i></p>
