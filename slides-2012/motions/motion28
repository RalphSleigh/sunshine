<b>Motion 28: Group Registration System</b>
<p>
This Annual Conference notes the new group registration fee introduced in 2012. Aspects of the new
scheme appear unnecessarily cumbersome and do nothing to simplify the paperwork demanded
by the centre from our often hard pressed volunteers at group and district level. Therefore this
conference instructs General Council to introduce the ability of groups to pay a flat rate £125 as an
alternative to £50 plus £5 per registered member.</p>

<p><b>Supporting information:</b><i>
The new group membership scheme means that groups with over 15 members will have to find the
additional funding gap between their registered membership and the Co-op grant to most groups of £125.
This puts additional strain upon groups that are often combatting high hall rentals. And it assumes all
groups are efficient in collecting subs. The Woodcraft Folk, we are told, is a diverse organisation where
“one size does not fit all”. This change will give a degree of flexibility to hard pressed local groups.</i></p>
