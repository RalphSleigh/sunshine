<b>Motion 9: Publish election procedures and results</b><p>
This Annual Conference notes that at previous conferences there have been in some cases a lack of
understanding how the election for General Council and Standing Orders committee works, and
that as a result of this, the candidates elected did not always match the intention of the delegates. This
annual conference therefore calls on standing orders committee to:<ul><li>
Make available to delegates before and at conference resources explaining as simply as possibly</li><li>
how the electoral system being used works.
After each election publish the full numeric results of the election, including the number of
votes cast for each candidate and the results of any rounds of election used (as determined by the
system).</li></ul></p>
<i>Proposed and Seconded by Ealing and Hammersmith.</i>
<p><b>Supporting information:</b><i>
Democracy is at the heart of the Woodcraft Folkâ€™s principles, so it is important that we do it justice. This
motion will help to empower our delegates to better express their preferences in Woodcraft Folk elections,
and provide greater transparency in the results.</i></p>
