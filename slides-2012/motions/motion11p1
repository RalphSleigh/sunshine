<b>Motion 11: Project Koodoo: Co-operative Campsites</b>
<p>This Annual Conference notes that:<ul style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>
In the consultation of all members and groups carried out as part of the Big Plan process, Camping
& Outdoor Adventures was clearly the top priority.</li><li>
In 2010 Annual Gathering voted to add explicit growth goals to the Big Plan to make the
Woodcraft Folk ‘Bigger and Better’.</li><li>
Inspired by the 1942 vision of Henry Fair (whose Folk Name was Koodoo), and combining
the organisation’s clear priorities of camping and growth, in July 2011 General Council set the
aspirational goal of securing a new national campsite for the Woodcraft Folk in time for the next
international camp in 2017.</li><li>
Project Koodoo was launched at CoCamp and has been the subject of wide discussion in the
movement, with workshops at CoCamp, in districts, at regional gatherings and in online forums.</li><li>
Project Koodoo has caught the imagination of many in our movement, particularly our young
members, and our partners in the co-operative movement.</li><li>
Since the launch of Project Koodoo, we have started discussions with several parts of the co-
operative movement about a number of regional centres or sites.</li><li>
In December 2011, responding to discussion in the movement, General Council decided to review
the goals of Project Koodoo refocusing the project on local campsites, while retaining a long term
aspiration of a new national site.</li><li>
That the District Fellows Movement is developing a linked project, The Share, to create a national
DF centre.</li></ul></p>
