<b>Motion 19: A Right to Meet - Substantive A1</b>

<p>This Annual Conference notes the difficulty for many groups in having an affordable place to meet.
This leads to groups closing and can make it very difficult for new groups to be set up. We believe
that it is every child and young personâ€™s right to go to groups without being excluded because of the
expense of paying for halls in publicly funded buildings.<br />
This Annual Conference calls upon General Council to launch a campaign in co-operation with
the Scouts, Guides and other voluntary organisations in raising this issue with government and local
authorities with the aim that our Woodcraft Folk groups have a free place to meet. The
campaign group should report on actions and progress via the news section of the website.</p>
