<b>Amendment 1 to motion 16:</b><p>
Replace everything between ‘This conference’ and ‘to its full potential’ with:
(This Conference) “celebrates the enormous value of camping and outdoor activity to the Folk. As
such, we seek to congratulate Park Farm management committee on their great work and recognise
what a brilliant site Park Farm is. This conference also recognises that restrictions on camping at Park
Farm have had a detrimental impact on the site’s potential and that it is vital to the Folk that we have a
fully useable campsite.<br />
As such, General Council, working closely with Park Farm management committee, are instructed
to resolve these restrictions as a matter of top priority, as a short term goal. They are given mandate to
seek legal advice on the situation and take the course of action to lift the restrictions that they see fit.
This conference feels only a fundamental change in society will prevent restrictions like those at
Park Farm being enforced again. Thus, for a long term goal, General Council and staff are encouraged
to renew efforts to promote a ‘Right to Play’ philosophy and target these proactive, educational efforts
at the Lurgashall community. A potential course of action would be to invite locals into Park Farm on
an open day.<br />
General Council are requested to actively promote discussion within Woodcraft on the possible
long and short term solutions to the Park Farm restrictions. General Council are instructed to take
these ideas into account and given mandate act upon ideas of their choosing in regard to lifting the
restrictions on Park Farm.<br />
If it becomes apparent that the short term goal of lifting restrictions will only work if our long
term goal of changing the psyche of society is in place first (and our long term goal is not in place by
2017) General Council are given mandate to sell Park Farm to an ethical buyer. All funds ought to go
directly back into purchasing a new campsite/s for Woodcraft.<br />
Conference hopes selling Park Farm will not have to happen, although we realise that getting
the restrictions lifted is vital. Therefore, this conference calls upon all Woodcrafters to aid General
Council, the Park Farm management committee and staff in the long and short term goals so that
Park Farm can be used” (to its full potential).</p>
