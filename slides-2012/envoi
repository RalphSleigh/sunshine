<p>This shall be for a bond between us,<br/>
That we are of one blood you and I,<br />
That we cry peace to all,<br />
And claim kinship with every living thing,<br />
That we hate war and sloth and greed,<br />
And love fellowship,<br />
And we shall go singing to the fashioning of a new world.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
